# AIMS - An Automated Immune Molecule Separator

# Description
The primary goal of AIMS is to identify discriminating factors between two distinct sets of immune molecules. Currently the software can be applied to
immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules such as T cell receptors and antibodies, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and MHC-like molecules. 
AIMS is a python package distributed in both a notebook and GUI format. Those wishing to use the notebooks
just need to download this repository and the necessary packages identified in AIMS/app/install_packages.sh. Those
wishing to use the GUI, particularly those relatively new to programming, can follow the installation instructions below.
Example data is provided in AIMS/app/ab_testData and AIMS/app/mhc_testData, and an example of an application of AIMS can be seen in
this preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.229013v1

When publishing analysis from this software, please cite the preprint:

 Based Analysis of CDR Loops. BioRxiv. 2020.
And be on the lookout for the published version.
